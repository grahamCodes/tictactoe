// creates an x or an o on click
// needs an event listener for this

// once three in a row, even listener to condiiton win

// create a variable
// starts at x
// checks if its an x. if its an x,c hange to an o
// checks if its an o. if its an o, change to an x

// html
// create a main container
// create an h1 for the text
// create an h2 to show the players turn
// createa  container for the grid
// create 9 small squares inside the container

// js
// 1 querySelectorAll to get all the boxes. Its a node list/array
// 2 loop through array of boxes
//     3 add a click event
//          4   add either an x or o inside the box (create h1 element, and text content, and append inside the box that is clicked)
//              there are some things missing in step 4 we gotta figure out
//          5   check if there is a winner
// 6 Create a function to check if there's a winner
// ** things to be aware of
// - after an O or X is added, it shouldn't be able to be changed
// - after someone wins, no more Xs or Os can be added

// STEPS
// 1. create a grid
// 2. be able to add x and o oto each square
// 3. be able to  determine a winner
// 4. prevent changing already played squares
// 5. be able to stop the game after someone wins
